```text
http://localhost:5002
```

## Routes

```text
GET    /                     API health check
GET    /api/summary          Dashboard summary data
GET    /api/systems          List mission systems
POST   /api/systems          Create a mission system
DELETE /api/systems/:id      Delete a mission system
GET    /api/incidents        List cyber incidents
POST   /api/incidents        Create a cyber incident

# Database Tables

MissionShield uses SQLite with two main tables:

## Systems

Stores mission system readiness data:

- System name
- Category
- Readiness status
- Cyber risk level
- Assigned team
- Last checked date
- Notes
- Created timestamp

## Incidents

Stores cyber incident data:

- Incident title
- Description
- Severity
- Status
- Affected system
- Reported by
- Response notes
- Created timestamp
